Yes — you absolutely can make **Markov Neural Network (MNN) Transformers**. In fact, what we’ve been building is already pointing in that direction. Let me lay it out:

## 🔑 What a Transformer Normally Does

A standard GPT-style Transformer has:

1. **Embeddings** → tokens into vectors.
2. **Self-Attention** → computes how tokens attend to each other using learned weight matrices $W_Q, W_K, W_V$.
3. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)** → position-wise transformations with linear layers.
4. **Stacked Blocks** with residuals + normalization.

All the heavy lifting comes from those **linear projections**.

## 🔁 How to “Markovize” a Transformer

To make it an **MNN Transformer**:

* **Replace linear weights** (in Q, K, V, O projections and FFN layers) with **Markov transition matrices**.

  * These are **row-stochastic matrices**, so they encode probabilistic flows between hidden dimensions.
* **Computation** becomes:

  $$
  Q = X P_Q,\quad K = X P_K,\quad V = X P_V
  $$

  where each $P$ is a Markov transition.
* **Attention** is still:

  $$
  \text{Attn}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right)V
  $$

  but Q, K, V came from Markov transitions instead of arbitrary dense matrices.
* **FFN layers** are also Markov transitions stacked with nonlinearities, rather than unconstrained `nn.Linear`.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

* Keeps the **Markov property**: every “weight” is a transition probability.
* Models evolve by redistributing probability mass across dimensions, not by arbitrary weight updates.
* Can be combined with **LoRA-style adapters**: frozen stochastic base + small trainable low-rank corrections.
* This gives you a **probabilistic Transformer** where every parameter has a clear interpretation as “probability of transitioning between latent states.”

## 🧩 Architecture Sketch (Markov Transformer Block)

* **Input**: embeddings $X$.
* **Self-Attention**: use Markov transitions for Q, K, V.
* **FFN**: use stacked Markov layers with nonlinearities.
* **Residuals + Norms**: same as GPT.
* **Stack Blocks**: depth builds expressiveness.

```python
class MarkovAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, n_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.q_proj = MarkovLayer(dim)
        self.k_proj = MarkovLayer(dim)
        self.v_proj = MarkovLayer(dim)
        self.o_proj = MarkovLayer(dim)
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        self.d_head = dim // n_heads

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        B, T, C = x.shape
        Q = self.q_proj(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, self.d_head).transpose(1, 2)
        K = self.k_proj(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, self.d_head).transpose(1, 2)
        V = self.v_proj(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, self.d_head).transpose(1, 2)

        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-1, -2)) / (self.d_head ** 0.5)
        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
        attn = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

        out = torch.matmul(attn, V)
        out = out.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C)
        return self.o_proj(out)
```

## ✅ Summary

An **MNN Transformer**:

* Keeps the Transformer structure (attention + FFN + residuals).
* Replaces all learned weight matrices with **Markov transition matrices**.
* Produces a **probabilistic neural architecture**: every transformation is a probability flow.
* Can be extended with **LoRA adapters, noise, and dithering** for more flexibility.

👉 Do you want me to put together a **full training-ready Markov Transformer** (like GPT-2, with embeddings, blocks, and LM head) so you could actually train it on text?
